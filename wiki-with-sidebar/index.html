                <h1>Animal Crossing: Wild World</h1>
                <p>
                    Animal Crossing: Wild World[a] is a 2005 social simulation 
                    video game developed and published by Nintendo for the 
                    Nintendo DS handheld game console. It was released in Japan 
                    in November 2005, in North America and Australia in December 
                    2005, and in Europe in March 2006. It is the second 
                    installment in the Animal Crossing series, and the sequel to 
                    Animal Crossing on the GameCube.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wild World focuses on living in a remote village populated 
                    with anthropomorphic animals, where the player character is 
                    encouraged to perform any number of tasks, such as 
                    collecting and planting. Like all Animal Crossing titles, 
                    the game is synced to the console’s clock and calendar, 
                    allowing the game to be played in real-time, which affects 
                    the occurrence of in-game events based on the current time 
                    of day or season. Wild World utilized Nintendo Wi-Fi 
                    Connection, which allowed players to travel and visit the 
                    villages of other players via online play, until the service 
                    was shut down in May 2014.[1]

                    The game received positive reviews upon release, garnering 
                    aggregate scores of 86/100 on Metacritic and GameRankings.
                    [2][3] Wild World is the ninth best-selling game on the 
                    Nintendo DS with 11.75 million copies sold worldwide as of 
                    March 31, 2016.[4] It was additionally re-released on the 
                    Wii U Virtual Console in October 2016.[5]

                    <p>
                        Like all the games in the Animal Crossing series, Wild 
                        World is an open-ended game in which the player assumes 
                        the role of a human who has moved into a village 
                        populated with anthropomorphic animals.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    During their time spent in the village, the player is able 
                    to perform a number of various activities, such as 
                    collecting items, fish and insects, or socializing with the 
                    village’s residents.[6] The game is synchronized with the 
                    Nintendo DS clock and calendar, allowing the game to be 
                    played in real-time. For example, both daytime and night 
                    will occur in the village depending on the current hour, 
                    and snow will fall during the cold months. Different events 
                    occur at particular times of the year, such as holidays and 
                    the variation of collectible fauna depending on the month 
                    or season.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wild World features a high level of customization. The 
                    player character‘s appearance can be modified to the 
                    player’s preference: it can be dressed from a large 
                    selection of available clothes and accessories, or players 
                    can design new clothing patterns from scratch with help 
                    from the village tailor, Able Sisters. The environment 
                    itself can be modified: trees can be grown or chopped down 
                    in any part of the village, and the players share a house 
                    that can be furnished with collected furniture and items. 
                    Wild World adds the ability to draw constellations that are 
                    visible in the night sky.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wild World utilizes the dual screens of the Nintendo DS in 
                    various ways. The game allows players to interact via the 
                    system’s touch screen and stylus, which is used to manage 
                    the players inventory, write messages, draw designs for 
                    clothes, or control the character.[7] Unlike the previous 
                    iteration which had used a top-down perspective, Wild World 
                    allows both the ground and sky to be visible at the same 
                    time on each of the screens, allowing the players to view 
                    events occurring in the sky without needing to switch 
                    perspectives. This is done by using a “rolling log” effect, 
                    in which the terrain seems to bend and roll beneath the 
                    player’s feet when travelling about the village.[8]

                    The game was announced at E3 2004 under the tentative title 
                    Animal Crossing DS, where it was revealed to utilize the 
                    Nintendo DS touch screen and implement multiplayer 
                    capabilities.[11] When development on Animal Crossing: Wild 
                    World began, it was decided that nothing was going to be 
                    region-specific in order to make the game easier to 
                    localize.[12] Therefore, certain events that were 
                    originally observed in Animal Crossing, such as those based 
                    on Halloween, Christmas, and the Japanese Cherry Blossom 
                    Festival, are not observed in Wild World.[13][14] This rule 
                    was applied to the variety of fish and insects the player 
                    is able to collect.[12]

                <p>
                    Wild World was the first game in the Animal Crossing series 
                    to feature online play and was the second game on the DS to 
                    utilize the now defunct Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, with 
                    which players could visit other villages. Because players 
                    were required to exchange and register Friend Codes prior 
                    to visiting, connection to random villages was not possible. 
                    Up to four DS systems can explore the same village 
                    simultaneously.[9] Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection can be used to 
                    exchange items and custom-designed patterns between players, 
                    as well as receiving exclusive gifts from Nintendo while 
                    connected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wild World is compatible with its Wii successor, Animal C
                    rossing: City Folk. Players are able to transfer their 
                    player from Wild World to City Folk via a wireless 
                    connection between the two consoles.[10]

                    As of May 20, 2014, online functionality offered through 
                    Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection is no longer accessible. The 
                    discontinued services include online play, matchmaking and 
                    leaderboards in which Animal Crossing: Wild World, as well 
                    as many other online DS and Wii games, are affected.[1]

                        referring to the changes as incremental.

                    The addition of online play was praised by many critics. 
                    Computer and Video Games felt that the online play 
                    “extends the experience into true social gaming,”[21] and 
                    IGN stated that “Nintendo gave us everything we were asking 
                    for when playing the GameCube version: a much more 
                    intuitive way of trading items and enjoying other players’ 
                    creations. And, at the very least, the company 
                    succeeded.”[9] However, multiplayer was also criticized for 
                    its tedious implementation and questionable restrictions, 
                    specifically the requirement of Friend Codes and the 
                    inability to send mail to other players unless he or she 
                    was visiting that person’s village.[6][7][9] Other online 
                    oddities mentioned include the disappearance of all animal 
                    residents during the visit[7][9] and the fact that North 
                    American and European players are unable to connect with 
                    Japanese players. Wild World producer Katsuya Eguchi stated 
                    that these limitations were due to hardware and memory 
                    constraints.[14]

                    During the 9th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the 
                    Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences nominated Animal 
                    Crossing: Wild World for “Simulation Game of the Year“.[31] 
                    In 2009, Official Nintendo Magazine called the game 
                    “Brilliant!”, placing it 23rd on a list of greatest
