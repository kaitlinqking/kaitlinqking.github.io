                <p>
                    "What can you do in Pawhuska, Oklahoma?” A few years back, 
                    the answer may not have been so obvious. Established in 1872 
                    and located in the heart of Osage County, the city has 
                    always had a rich history and unique culture. But few were 
                    aware of everything Pawhuska has to offer until Ree and 
                    Ladd introduced this charming town to the world.
                <p>
                    Ree moved to Pawhuska when she married Ladd, an area cattle 
                    rancher. She was raised in nearby Bartlesville and was a 
                    city girl at heart, so she admits she was a fish out of 
                    water at first. "I was the last person anyone ever 
                    pictured moving to the country," she says.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But over time, Ree embraced her rural surroundings. In 2006, 
                    she started The Pioneer Woman blog to share updates about 
                    raising four kids on the ranch and her life in Pawhuska. 
                    That led to a cookbook in 2009 and a Food Network show of 
                    the same name in 2011. Suddenly, fans across the country 
                    wanted to know more about the sleepy little town where Ree 
                    lived. Soon, Ree and Ladd decided to take a risk on their 
                    next big project.

                    The Drummonds opened their first business in Pawhuska's 
                    downtown area in 2016: The Mercantile, a restaurant, bakery 
                    and general store. The Merc quickly became a must-visit for 
                    those who wanted to experience The Pioneer Woman small town 
                    lifestyle first hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As tourists flocked to downtown Pawhuska, Ree and Ladd 
                    decided to build on the success of the Merc with an eight 
                    room inn, pizza place, and ice cream parlor. Now, you can 
                    book a room at The Boarding House; grab a slice at P-Town 
                    Pizza; load up on ice cream at Charlie’s Sweet Shop; and 
                    even poke around the set of The Pioneer Woman during a tour 
                    of the Lodge, located on Drummond Ranch.

                    Ree-related activities are of course the main draw, but 
                    you'll find plenty of other interesting things to do around 
                    town. Take a tour and see why Ree and her family are proud 
                    to call Pawhuska home.

                    If you love a good road trip, then you can, of course, 
                    drive to Pawhuska. We suggest listening to some true crime 
                    podcasts to make the trip more exciting!

                    If you're flying, the nearest airport is Tulsa International 
                    Airport (TUL), located about 56 miles away. Another option 
                    is Oklahoma City, which offers a few more direct flights 
                    from major cities but is roughly a two-hour drive from 
                    downtown Pawhuska. You can grab a rental car from most 
                    companies at both airports. Safe travels!
